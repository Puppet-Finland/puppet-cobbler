[Unit]
Description=cobbler sync
After=cobblerd.service
Requires=cobblerd.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cobbler sync
Type=simple

# Even though this service is started after cobblerd.service, cobblerd is 
# actually _not_ ready to serve connections immediately after startup. This 
# means that "cobbler sync" may fail on the first try; hence the Restart option 
# is needed.
#
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
